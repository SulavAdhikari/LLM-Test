## Overview
This repository contains a program focused on fetching data from the Wikipedia API for Premier League and La Liga clubs. 
Initially, we attempted to utilize a bigram model for processing the data. However, due to memory constraints and local storage limitations, this approach was unsuccessful.
As a result, we have implemented a transformer model. Please note that while the algorithm of this transformer model is not yet fully optimized, we are committed to refining it in the future iterations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Internet connection for fetching data from Wikipedia API
