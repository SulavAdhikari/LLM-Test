## Overview
This repository contains an LLM (Large Language Model) for a simple chatbot for football conversations and fetching data from the Wikipedia API for Premier League and La Liga clubs. Initially, we attempted to utilize a bigram model for processing the data. However, due to memory constraints and local storage limitations, this approach was unsuccessful. As a result, we have implemented a transformer model. Please note that while the algorithm of this transformer model is not yet fully tested, we are committed to refining it in future iterations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Internet connection for fetching data from the Wikipedia API


## Steps

- Data collection: completed with Wikipedia API
- Tokenizer setup: completed with GPT3 tokenizer
- Model setup: Failed trainig Bigram Model. Completed setup of Transformer Model.
- Training the model: TBD
- Test Evaluation: TBD
- Fine Tuning Data collection: TBD
- Fine Tuning: TBD
- API implementation: TBD


## Contribution

Just send a PR man. We don't know what we're doing here. We're not that good at math. Help will be appretiated.
